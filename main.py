'''Problem Statement:

You are tasked with developing a simple online store application for a client. 
Your application should allow users to browse products, add them to a cart, and checkout. 
You should also implement a simple inventory management system to track available products.

Your application should have the following functionalities:

A login system for users and administrators.
A product catalog that displays all available products and their prices.
A search function that allows users to search for products by name or category.
A shopping cart that allows users to add and remove products.
A checkout system that calculates the total price and confirms the order.
An inventory management system that allows administrators to add, edit, and delete products.
You should design and implement a database schema to store product and user information. 
You should also use a web framework of your choice to implement the user interface and server-side logic.

You should write at least 5 test cases to ensure that your application works as intended.'''

# Register a user
from ast import Dict, List
from ctypes import Union


def register(username: str, password: str) -> bool:
    pass

# Login a user


def login(username: str, password: str) -> bool:
    pass

# Add a new product to the catalog


def add_product(name: str, category: str, price: float, stock: int) -> bool:
    pass

# Edit an existing product in the catalog


def edit_product(product_id: int, name: str, category: str, price: float, stock: int) -> bool:
    pass

# Remove a product from the catalog


def remove_product(product_id: int) -> bool:
    pass

# Search for products by name or category


def search_products(query: str) -> List[Dict[str, Union[int, str, float]]]:
    pass

# Add a product to the user's cart


def add_to_cart(user_id: int, product_id: int, quantity: int) -> bool:
    pass

# Remove a product from the user's cart


def remove_from_cart(user_id: int, product_id: int, quantity: int) -> bool:
    pass

# Checkout the user's cart


def checkout(user_id: int) -> bool:
    pass


'''These test cases cover a range of scenarios such as registering a user, 
adding/editing/removing products, searching for products, adding/removing products from the cart, and checking out.'''
